I'm working on getting proper subtitles for this (there should be automatically generated, but they might not always be accurate).

Prerequisites for course:
- Have [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed.

You find the lecture slides in the 'lectures' folder. All the tutorial notebooks (named Python lesson X) and exercises (Python exercise X). Additional (easier) exercises are also available in the 'additional exercises' folder. Answers for all the exercises are also available.
