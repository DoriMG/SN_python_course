    "You are given data about iris sepal and petal width and length (X, if you want to know more about the dataset, look at the iris variable). You are also given the classification of each row (y; species of iris, 0, 1 or 2). The goal is to perform logistic regression (a type of classification) on this data. Hint: have a look at the sklearn documentation for logistic regression.\n",
