    "# Introduction to Python exercises\n",

    "- Part 1: calculations, text operations and compound variables\n",

    "In this part you will learn the very basics of the Python language, and it is meant to get you comfortable with Python. After doing this section you'll know how to do basic calculations, manipulate strings and lists and work with dictionaries and tuples.\n",
    "- Part 2: Conditionals, for-loops and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will build on the basics and start using conditionals, for-loops and you will even write your first function. After this section you'll have all the basics of Python down and are ready to start learning NumPy\n",
