This dataset contains information about the medication and speech patterns of Parkinson's patients (original: https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/early-biomarkers-of-parkinsons-disease/downloads/early-biomarkers-of-parkinsons-disease.zip/2). The data is loaded into the variable data. This is what the data in each column represents:\n",
